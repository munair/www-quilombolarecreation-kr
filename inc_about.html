<h1>The Proprietor</h1>
<p>Munair Simpson, born in Jamaica, is a marketing strategist and the proprietor of the Quilombola Company, a private enterprise focused on bootstrap strategies and international business development in the arts, entertainment, and recreation.</p>
<p>Munair developed the desire to develop business in these areas after balancing the exigies of learning and teaching the Afro-Brazilian art form called Capoeira while he worked his way from the bottom up in the telecommunications, Internet, and new media industries in South Korea, the United States, and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>A few years after founding the Cordão de Ouro Capoeira group in Seoul in 2009, Munair discovered that teaching Capoeira in Korea had the power to fundamentally change lives in a wholesome way. Consequently, Munair, or “Instructor Zumbi” as he is called in Capoeira cirles, gained the conviction that teaching traditional arts and helping others to self-actualize in their ventures was the best way to be of service to society.</p>
<p>Prior to retiring from the corporate world to teach capoeira, Munair was a senior manager at SK Telecom. While at SK, Munair worked with Mediapeers (Berlin-based) to launch the Asia-focused, online business-to-business content exchange called "Trade All Content". Munair graduated from the Wharton School with an MBA in Marketing.</p>
