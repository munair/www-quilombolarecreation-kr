	<p>Join us on Friday evenings at 8:30 PM for Capoeira fundamentals. In these sessions we train fundamental kicks and escapes, magical ginga steps, and a few other basic movements essential to expressing yourself in a Capoeira game. These movements look easy, but they are truly difficult to master. Mastery can take years, but no matter how long the journey takes, training Capoeira is always a fun and challenging workout filled with activities that make great and lasting friendships.<br /><br />
	The class is taught to a cohort. The cohort size is 10 people. The class runs for one month. You can signup again and again. There is no limit to the number of times you can <a href="mailto:info@quilombolarecreation.kr">signup</a> for this course.
