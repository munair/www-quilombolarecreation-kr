	<h2 class="faq" data-picture="1">Beginners</h2>
	<p>Join us every weekday evening at 7:30 PM for Capoeira fundamentals. In these sessions we train fundamental kicks and escapes, magical ginga steps, and a few other basic movements essential to expressing yourself in a Capoeira game. These movements look easy, but they are truly difficult to master. Mastery can take years, but no matter how long the journey takes, training Capoeira is always a fun and challenging workout filled with activities that make great and lasting friendships.<br /><br />
